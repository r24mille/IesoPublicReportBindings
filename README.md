IESO Public Report Bindings
===========================

Java libraries for parsing public XML reports from Ontario's Independent Electricity System Operator (IESO). The reports are styled nicely for the web and viewable at http://reports.ieso.ca/public/

This open source project was started by Reid Miller, a graduate student at the University of Waterloo. The libraries have not been reviewed or approved by the IESO. I'm just working with public data and sharing my work.
